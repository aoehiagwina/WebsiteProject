I am currently developing my skillset in the field of computer science with key interest in software development and data science. I am a youth mentor at the deeper Christian life and a student mentor at LJMU. I am a fast learner with strong intrinsic desire to succeed. I am self-motivated, but I also enjoy collaborating with others. I am creative, resourceful, flexible and able to adapt to changing priorities. I love charitable services, accomplishing goals and spending time with family.
